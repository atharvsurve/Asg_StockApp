The name of the stock
Its amount
Intra-day performance (highlighted in green or red)
A description of the stock
The percentage change of the stock
Features
Automatic Loading of JSON Data: The app automatically reads stock data from a db.json file upon initialization.
Dynamic Data Handling: The app dynamically populates the UI based on the data provided in the JSON file.
Formatted Stock Data: Each stock entry is formatted with color-coded intra-day performance (green for positive, red for negative).
